I'd like your visual design critique on this sales one-pager.

**Context:**
- Target audience: Local service businesses (plumbers, dentists, lawyers, etc.)
- Purpose: Sales pitch document to book free discovery calls
- Brand feel: Premium, trustworthy, modern tech-forward
- Will be used as: PDF handout + digital share

**What was built:**
- Dark theme with gradient background
- Problem-first framing ("You're losing money every night at 6pm")
- 78% stat as the pain point
- 3 solution pillars with icons and outcome stats
- Proof strip with 3 key metrics
- Single amber CTA button
- Clean footer

**Please provide:**

1. **Visual Polish** (3 specific things)
   - What micro-details would you refine?
   - Spacing, alignment, color balance, typography?
   - Does anything feel slightly "off"?

2. **Hierarchy & Flow**
   - Does the eye move correctly through the page?
   - Is anything competing for attention that shouldn't?

3. **Alternative Ideas** (1-2 suggestions)
   - What would you try differently?
   - Any fresh directions worth exploring?
   - Could any section be more impactful?

Keep feedback actionable. I'll implement the best suggestions in Claude Code.
